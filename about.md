# Minjae Kim

__TL;DR__: a master's student who is interested in deep learning system optimization for mobile devices.

I am a master's student in the department of computer science and engineering at Seoul National University. I received my bachelor degree in computer science from POSTECH.

I am currently in [Software Platform Lab](https://spl.snu.ac.kr) (advised by [Prof. Byung-gon Chun](http://bgchun.github.io/)). I worked as an undergraduate research intern at [Computing Systems Lab](https://syslab.postech.ac.kr) (advised by [Prof. Hyojin Sung](https://hsung.postech.ac.kr/)).

Now, I am interested in accelerating computation heavy systems with software optimization for heterogeneous mobile devices. Currently, my main focus is on deep learning but I don't limit my interest to it. I strongly believe that cross-domain optimization from silicon to human is essential for deep learning (or any other areas) to penetrate our daily lives.

## Experiences
- __Machine Learning Engineer @ Team ISLAND, Aug 2020 ~ Sep 2020__  
Worked on building a lightweight 3D pose estimation model via knowledge distillation. To distill the knowledge from the regression-based teacher model, conducted label smoothing based on a gaussian filter to the output of the teacher model and jointly trained the student model with both the teacher model and the ground truth.
- __Software Engineer (Outsourced work) @ [Richbeam](http://www.mel-chi.com/help/richbeam), May 2020 ~ July 2020__  
  Migrated the complex backend system consisting of Flask, Tornado, and gRPC servers, which was already deployed on the private on-premise server, to the AWS Cloud with load balancing techniques.
- __Software Engineer (Full-time) @ [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com), Sep 2019 ~ Mar 2020__  
  Worked on the whole infrastructure used for on-chain analysis and data provisioning. The system involves PostgreSQL, Flask, Redis, and MongoDB. 99.997% of the availability was achieved in the designed system, which is crucial in the financial field. Also, participated in an anti-money laundering system, which helped to solve the biggest sexual abuse “N-th room” in Korea.
- __CTO & Co-Founder @ DSigner, Sep 2018 ~ Sep 2019__  
  Developed a font navigation system to help designers to explore the proper font in a huge amount of typography. Auto-encoder-based embedding was engineered with the expert knowledge of typeface. Also, worked on backend servers using Flask, MySQL, and MongoDB. Interviewed in YC 2020 Spring Batch.
- __Research Intern @ [HodooAI](https://www.hodooai.com), Apr 2018 ~ Aug 2018__  
  Researched transferring makeup between non-labeled face images. By matching the corresponding regions with local embeddings and applying the color transfer techniques on those matches, successfully transferred makeup without any guidance from humans.
- __Software Engineer Intern @ [byclip](http://www.byclip.com), Jun 2017 ~ Aug 2017__  
  Developed a chatbot management system with MongoDB and Express, and developed an interactive item-based recommender system for restaurants.

## Others
I was a finalist of International Science and Engineering Fair sponsored by Intel (Intel ISEF 2015). 

I deejay house music, especially for deep house and tech house.
