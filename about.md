# Minjae Kim

__TL;DR__: a Ph.D. student who is interested in deep learning system optimization for mobile devices.

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University. I received a master's degree in computer science from SNU and my bachelor's degree in computer science from POSTECH.

I am currently in [Human-centered Computer Systems Lab](https://hcs.snu.ac.kr) (advised by [Prof. Youngki Lee](https://youngkilee.blogspot.com/)), was in [Software Platform Lab](https://spl.snu.ac.kr) (advised by [Prof. Byung-Gon Chun](http://bgchun.github.io/)), and worked as an undergraduate research intern at [Computing Systems Lab](https://syslab.postech.ac.kr) (advised by [Prof. Hyojin Sung](https://hsung.snu.ac.kr/)).

Now, I am interested in accelerating computation-heavy systems with software optimization for heterogeneous mobile devices. Currently, my main focus is on deep learning, but I don't limit my interest to it. I firmly believe that cross-domain optimization from silicon to human is essential for deep learning (or any other areas) to penetrate our daily lives.

## Experiences
- __Machine Learning Engineer @ Team ISLAND, Aug 2020 ~ Sep 2020__  
Worked on building a lightweight 3D pose estimation model via knowledge distillation. To distill the knowledge from the regression-based teacher model, conducted label smoothing based on a Gaussian filter to the output of the teacher model and jointly trained the student model with both the teacher model and the ground truth.
- __Software Engineer (Outsourced work) @ [Richbeam](https://www.smelchi.com/), May 2020 ~ July 2020__  
  Migrated the complex backend system consisting of Flask, Tornado, and gRPC servers, which was already deployed on the private on-premise server, to the AWS Cloud with load balancing techniques.
- __Software Engineer (Full-time) @ [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com), Sep 2019 ~ Mar 2020__  
  Worked on the whole infrastructure used for on-chain analysis and data provisioning. The system involves PostgreSQL, Flask, Redis, and MongoDB. 99.997% of the availability was achieved in the designed system, which is crucial in the financial field. Also, participated in an anti-money laundering system, which helped to solve the biggest sexual abuse “N-th room” in Korea.
- __CTO & Co-Founder @ DSigner, Sep 2018 ~ Sep 2019__  
  Developed a font navigation system to help designers explore the proper font in a lot of typography. Auto-encoder-based embedding was engineered with the expert knowledge of typeface. Also, worked on backend servers using Flask, MySQL, and MongoDB. Interviewed in YC 2020 Spring Batch.
- __Research Intern @ [HodooAI](https://www.hodooai.com), Apr 2018 ~ Aug 2018__  
  Researched transferring makeup between non-labeled face images. By matching the corresponding regions with local embeddings and applying the color transfer techniques on those matches, successfully transferred makeup without any guidance from humans.
- __Software Engineer Intern @ [byclip](http://www.byclip.com), Jun 2017 ~ Aug 2017__  
  Developed a chatbot management system with MongoDB and Express and an interactive item-based recommender system for restaurants.

## Others
I was a finalist at the International Science and Engineering Fair sponsored by Intel (Intel ISEF 2015). 

I deejay house music, especially for deep house and tech house.
